This folder contains samples from the website where pdf_generator was implemented, pdbdev.iodp.org

The .mov video is a screen recording of me viewing the site's webforms, downloading the proposal (which actually uses pdf_generator), and then perusing the downloaded PDF.

The other PDF files are proposals that were downloaded from this website (they also were created via pdf_generator).
